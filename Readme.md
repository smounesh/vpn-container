Routing a a Torrent container network through a Vpn Container :
</h1>

<h3> Step 1: Set up the VPN container: </h3>

  Install and configure the ProtonVPN container to act as your VPN service provider. Ensure it's configured to route traffic through the VPN tunnel.

<h3> Step 2: Set up the Torrent container </h3>

  Install and configure the exatorrent container to use the ProtonVPN container as its network service provider. This involves specifying the IP address or service name of the ProtonVPN container in the exatorrent container's configuration

<h3>Step 3: Configure Application Access</h3>

1) Determine how your applications will access the exatorrent container. If the applications are running on the same machine as the containers, they can typically access the containers using their internal IP addresses.

2) If the applications need to access the exatorrent container from a remote machine, ensure they're configured to use either the VPN container's IP address (if reachable from the remote machine) or the public IP address of your network (if the VPN container is configured to allow external access).

<h3>Step 4: Proxy Settings </h3>

1) If your applications need to access the internet through the VPN container, configure them to use the VPN container's IP address or service name as the proxy server.
   
2) Ensure that the VPN container is set up to act as a proxy server, forwarding traffic through the VPN tunnel.
